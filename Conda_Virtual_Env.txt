# to create a new env based upon spec-file.txt 
3. conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt 

OR

# to use the spec file to install its listed packages into an existing environment
4. conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt


# clone an existing env to a new one

6. conda list --explicit > OneDrive\Υπολογιστής\spec-file.txt

# extract requirements.txt (python 3)
7. pip3 freeze > OneDrive\Υπολογιστής\requirements.txt

8. pip install pipreqs and run pipreqs from the folder in which your project resides it will search all folders in the directory 
and generate a requirements.txt with only the specific requirements of that project.
You may need to run pipreqs --force if there is already a requirements.txt in that folder to overwrite it with the correct set of requirements.
